      <h2>How do I get promoted to Elder?</h2>
      <p>At the end of every war, we count how many stars you contributed, and we add it to your star count (click <a href="/star-chart/">here</a> to view how many stars you've gotten). Once you
        have 10 or more stars, you are eligible for promotion. This doesn't <em>guarantee</em> you'll be immediately be
        promoted, but you are <em>eligible</em> to become an Elder, and you will likely be promoted soon. However, keep in
        mind there are other factors that determine how fast you get promoted. In order of most significant to least significant,
        they are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>War Contribution (10 star minimum)</li>
        <li>Clan chat activity. Speak up! It shows that you're active.</li>
        <li>Donations</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
      
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I get promoted to Co-leader?</h2>
      <p>To be honest, we are not planning to promote anybody to Co-leader anytime soon, though it is still a possibility.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why did I get demoted?</h2>
      <p>If you've been demoted, you've either been inactive (no donations, no receptions, no chat messages, and no war opt-in) for
        a long time, or have opted into war, and only used one or zero attacks. Don't worry! If you use both attacks in the next
        few wars, you'll be re-premoted in no time!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>I forgot to opt-out and got kicked. That's not fair!</h2>
      <p>Don't worry! We all make mistakes, which is why
        we always invite members back once they have been kicked (unless they have done something flagrantly offensive).
        Once you are back from your trip, or are no longer super busy, then you can start playing CoC again and be welcomed
        back into our clan.</p>
