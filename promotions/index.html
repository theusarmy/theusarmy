      <h2>How do I get promoted to Elder?</h2>
      <p>Once you get a total of 10 or more war stars, you will be promoted to Elder. If you're not sure how many total stars
        you have gotten, click <a href="/star-chart/">here</a>.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I get promoted to Co-leader?</h2>
      <p>To be honest, we are not planning to promote anybody to Co-leader anytime soon, though it is still a possibility.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why did I get demoted?</h2>
      <p>If you've been demoted, you've either forgotten to use <em>both</em> attacks, or you haven't been playing CoC for a
      long time. If you get 10 more war stars, you will be promoted to Elder again.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why does the website say I have 0 war stars, when I had a lot more?</h2>
      <p>Leaving the clan, getting kicked out, or getting demoted will reset your war star progress to 0.
      However, you can still get Elder by getting 10 more war stars.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>I forgot to opt-out and got kicked. That's not fair!</h2>
      <p>Don't worry! We all make mistakes, which is why
        we always invite members back once they have been kicked (unless they have done something flagrantly offensive).
        Once you can start playing CoC again you'll be welcomed
        back into our clan.</p>
