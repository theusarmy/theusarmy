      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>To be promoted to Elder, you need to get at least 10 total stars in war. We keep track of how many each member has on this page. Note that you
      only need to get 10 <em>total</em> stars, not 10 <em>new</em> stars in war. So if you get three stars on a base that
      was previously two-starred, then you'll be awarded the full three stars, not just the one new star.</p>
      <p>If you're not on the chart, then it means you have not participated in a war yet. Also, if you have participated in a war
        a long time ago (before 6/10/17, which was when this site was created), your participation from that war will not be counted
        (sorry, the war log details can no longer be viewed).</p>
