      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>To be promoted to Elder, you need to get at least 10 total stars in war. You can see how many stars you have in total by looking at the table below.</p>
      <p>Note that we count <em>all</em> your war stars, not just your <em>new</em> war stars. So if you score 3 stars on a base
      that had previously been 2-starred, you will be awarded the full 3 stars, not just the 1 new star.</p>
      <p><em>Note: Stars from wars before 6/11/17 are not counted, because that is when this webpage was created.</em></p>

      <p>Protip: to make it easier for you to find your name, entries are in alphabetical order (so for example, "Fury" would
        come before "loones").</p>
