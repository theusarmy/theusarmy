      <h2>When do we war?</h2>
      <p>We war whenever enough members request a war in clan chat. Usually, this happens once or twice a week.</p>

      <h2>What are the consequences of particpating or not participating in war?</h2>
      <p>Well, that depends on how much you participate. See the table below.</p>

      <h2>Do I have to be in war?</h2>
      <p>Definitely not. If you set your war shield to red, you will not be put in wars. If you are accidentally
      added, you will be exempted from the normal consequences of inactivity.</p>
      <p>However, if you set your war shield to green, you will be expected to use both attacks to the best of your ability.
        If you set your shield to green and don't use both attacks, then you <em>will</em> face the full consequences.</p>
