      <h2>loones</h2>
      <p>Loones was one of the first U.S. Army members, and he's been here longer than I can remember. He's our highest leveled
        member, and is almost always #1 in war and donations. His second account is lil Loones.</p>

      <h2>Fury</h2>
      <p>Fury was also one of our first members. He is probably our third highest leveled member, but he and his second account
        FuryJr. are currently inactive (or "MIA, as loones likes to say).</p>

      <h2>Lin</h2>
      <p>Ever since he joined in 3/12/14, Lin has been unswerving in his loyalty to The Army. He went on hiatus for a few months in 2016, 
        but came back in 2017 and hand-coded this website.</p>
